Analysis Automation


AI Capabilities:
Automated Result Interpretation: AI that can analyze simulation outputs (stress contours, displacement plots, flow fields) and identify critical areas, failure modes, or performance deviations.
Predictive Maintenance: Using AI to predict potential failures or performance degradation based on simulated operating conditions and historical data.
Root Cause Analysis: AI that can help identify the underlying reasons for simulated performance issues or design flaws.
Design Validation: AI that can automatically check if a design meets all specified analysis criteria and flag any non-compliance.
Data Requirements: Simulation results, performance metrics, failure modes, material failure criteria, experimental test data.
Tools/Technologies:
Data visualization and analysis libraries
Machine Learning for anomaly detection and classification
Rule-based systems for design validation
