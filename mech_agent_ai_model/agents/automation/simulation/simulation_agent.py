Simulation Automation

AI Capabilities:
Automated Meshing: AI that can intelligently generate high-quality computational meshes for Finite Element Analysis (FEA) or Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based on geometry and simulation type.
Intelligent Solver Setup: AI that can automatically determine appropriate simulation types (static, dynamic, thermal, fluid), boundary conditions, material models, and solver settings.
Reduced Order Modeling (ROM): AI-driven techniques to create simplified models that approximate complex simulations, drastically reducing computation time.
Surrogate Modeling: Training AI models to predict simulation outcomes without running the full simulation, useful for rapid design iteration.
Adaptive Simulation: AI that can dynamically adjust simulation parameters or mesh refinement during a run to focus computational effort where it's most needed.

Data Requirements: Existing simulation setups, meshing strategies, solver settings, material properties, and corresponding simulation results.

Tools/Technologies:
FEA/CFD software APIs (e.g., ANSYS, COMSOL, Abaqus, OpenFOAM)
Machine Learning for regression and prediction (e.g., neural networks, Gaussian processes)
Data-driven meshing techniques
