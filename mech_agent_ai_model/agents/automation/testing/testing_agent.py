Testing Automation

AI Capabilities:
Test Case Generation: AI that can automatically generate relevant test scenarios based on design specifications and intended use cases.
Virtual Testing: Leveraging simulation results as a form of virtual testing, with AI guiding which simulations are most representative.
Real-World Test Planning & Execution: For physical testing, AI could plan the sequence of tests, control robotic testing equipment, and analyze sensor data.
Failure Mode Identification: AI analyzing test data to pinpoint specific failure mechanisms.
Test Data Analysis: Automating the processing and interpretation of large volumes of test data.

Data Requirements: Test plans, operational profiles, sensor data from physical tests, failure logs.

Tools/Technologies:
AI for planning and scheduling
Computer Vision for analyzing physical tests
Time-series analysis for sensor data
