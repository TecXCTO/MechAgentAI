3D Designing Automation

* AI Capabilities:
Generative Design: Using AI algorithms (like Generative Adversarial Networks - GANs, or variational 
autoencoders - VAEs) to create novel design concepts based on specified functional requirements, 
constraints (material, stress, weight, cost), and desired aesthetics.
Parametric Modeling & Feature Recognition: AI that understands the underlying parametric 
relationships in a CAD model and can automatically adjust parameters or add/modify features 
based on high-level instructions.
Knowledge-Based Design: Incorporating engineering knowledge (design rules, best practices, 
material science databases) into the AI to guide design decisions.
Design Optimization: AI algorithms that iteratively modify designs to optimize for specific 
performance metrics (e.g., strength-to-weight ratio, thermal performance).
Concept Generation & Exploration: AI that can quickly generate a variety of design alternatives to 
explore a wider design space.

* Data Requirements: Large datasets of existing 3D CAD models, design specifications, functional requirements, 
and performance data.

* Tools/Technologies:
CAD Software APIs (e.g., SolidWorks API, Fusion 360 API, Onshape API)
Geometric Deep Learning (e.g., PointNet, DGCNN)
Reinforcement Learning for design exploration
Optimization algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms, Bayesian optimization)
